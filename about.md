# About <br/> <br/>

My interest in design spurred during my undergraduate at <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu" target="_blank" title="Georgia Tech College of Computing's website">Georgia Tech</a> in Computer Science. And it only continued to increase when I started working full time at <a href="https://www.redfin.com" target="_blank" title="Redfin's website">Redfin</a>. My position was to ensure quality of our web and mobile applications. I really enjoyed thinking from our customer’s perspective and what they would feel while interacting with Redfin. Soon I started taking online classes on <a href="https://www.coursera.org" target="_blank" title="Coursera's Website">Coursera</a> about HCI and Design and such topics. Living in San Francisco was a design oriented learning experience in itself, meeting interesting people at bars or Meetups. I also enrolled in a <a href="https://novoed.com/design-kit-q3-2015/" target="_blank" title="Course Website">group course</a> offered by <a href="http://www.ideo.org" target="_blank" title"IDEO.org's Website">IDEO.org</a> about Human-Centered Design which was a grand learning experience. Now I am pursuing master's degree at <a href="https://medialab.aalto.fi" target="_blank" title="Aalto's Media Lab website">Aalto University</a> in New Media Design & Production. You can read a few recommendations for me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gurden-batra-2b750a2a" target="_blank" title="My LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a>.

I write on <a href="https://medium.com/@gurdenbatra" target="_blank" title="My Medium">Medium</a> occasionally. I’ve also always been an avid photographer. You should check out my <a href="https://instagram.com/gurden/" target="_blank" title="My Instagram">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gurden" target="_blank" title="My Flickr">Flickr</a>. And I write poetry and upload some experimental art on my <a href="http://gurden.tumblr.com" target="_blank" title="My Tumblr">Tumblr</a>.
