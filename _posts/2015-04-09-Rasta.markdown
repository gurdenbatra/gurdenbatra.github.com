<h2 class="headline">Research, Architecture, Wireframing</h2>

The project was to craft a website for Rasta to showcase what they are about and the work they do. It was clear that Rasta wasn’t just another design studio and they surely they did not want to portray themselves as one. Rasta is more about **brand strategy**, they help form your brand and things which go around it and help your brand to reach out to youth audience. They also love studying youth culture and wanted to document their observations on the website.

##Research
I interviewed the founder and everyone else on the team to get a feel of the company, their goals and their design aesthetic. Then formed flow graphs for youth culture and one for Rasta, to have a connected impression and terminology in hand. I understood the main things to showcase were Rasta’s creative solutions and that they loved and understood the youth culture. So we came up with a site map with the main navigation and the possible options to present under them.

##Homepage
Next step was the homepage. Being the chief real estate, getting most eyes and getting the first impression of the company. The design of the rest of the website would also flow from the homepage. So we explored a few alternatives and discussed over them.

##Homepage Iteration
We liked the the blocks layout from the first iteration, it nicely showcased our work and other content. We played with the layout to give it more of a dynamic effect to represent the youth.

##Content Architecture
We decided to keep a simple list of the four main things we do on the Work page and keep the nitty gritties on the case studies for those interested.

##Responsive
All pages were thought out from a responsive perspective from the start. Having the blocks layout, it was easy to make the layout flow into the screen size of the desired device.

##Next steps
The lead designer of Rasta and I worked together on the formal designs of the website with the imagery and interactions, using Photoshop. Then we found a freelance web developer who was equally excited about the project and wrote the website in PHP with a custom made CMS mechanism to keep the content updated.
