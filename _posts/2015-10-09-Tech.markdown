##Healthy Baby Monitor

Android application targeted for kids of ages 0-5 in rural India. App intended for areas where child healthcare is ignored and not properly monitored. Worked with team of 3 to create a simple app which can be used to measure and maintain stats like height, weight and vaccinations, and also generate graphs for them.
