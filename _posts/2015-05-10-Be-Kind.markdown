An iOS application to promote and inspire positivity through benevolent acts towards people around and the environment. Be Kind is a social network where you can check in a doing good activity and share it with everyone.

Design principles behind the app also aim to be kind. The interface and interactions are kept clean and simple. Light green color is used to resonate with nature and good feelings. And light blue color is used to denote tappable links and buttons.

There is no friends or followers list in the application. Everyone is a friend and is on the common feed which can be filtered by global or nearby. You can love, comment on or share an activity on you feed but the app doesn't display number of loves nor comments, there is no competition.

The check in screen first thanks you and confirms your activity incase the wrong button was tapped by mistake. The boxes are made big to welcome responses in form of text, picture and a location. Better the story more potential to inspire.

Forms have been made more easier and fun to fill than usual. Featuring inline validation and drop down for commonly used email domains(with the option to add a custom one of course). Hat tip to <a href="http://www.lukew.com/" target="_blank" title="Luke's Website">LukeW</a>.
