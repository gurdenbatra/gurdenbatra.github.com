A website to promote better web practices which lead to less server load and hence less CO2 emissions. The storytelling is done through parallax scorlling using <a href="https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr" target="_blank" title="Skrollr's Github page">Skrollr.js</a> where the server and client are having a dialogue. Right now I have a <a href="http://gurden.xyz/sustainable-web/" target="_blank" title="In Progress Page">working prototype</a> but we are still finalizing the design, animations and need to add the @media queries.

Working in collaboration with <a href="http://luk.design" target="_blank" title="LUK's homepage">LUK Design</a>.
